# ID-Card-Design-Template-in-Adobe-Illustrator


Design


I created this design simply by using shapes. The background was kept matching to the logo at the bottom of the front side and rest of the colors were just a symbol of creative color scheme that a graphic designer portraits. The rest of the card was super easy to design just keeping in mind the basic elements of an ID Card.
